"""Scoring for Phase 2: recall@k, cut by how discoverable the file was to begin with.

Phase 1 established that 51.3% of SWE-bench Lite issues never name the file to fix.
An aggregate recall number hides exactly that split - a retriever can look strong purely
by doing well on the half where the answer is written in the text. So every score here
is reported twice: overall, and per discoverability tier.

The tier breakdown is the result. If BM25 scores highly when the path is quoted and
collapses when it is not, then what a single SWE-bench number rewards is string matching,
and the reasoning half of the benchmark is being graded on a retrieval failure.

An instance whose gold file is missing from the repo listing is kept in the denominator
and scored as a miss. It cannot be retrieved by anything, so dropping it would flatter
every retriever equally and by an amount nobody could see.
