"""Repository file listings, fetched once per repo and cached on disk.

Phase 2 needs a candidate set: the files a retriever is allowed to choose from. The
gold patch names the answer but not the alternatives, so the file list has to come
from somewhere, and the Trees API gives it as paths only - no blobs, no clone.

**One tree per repository, not one per instance.** The 300 instances span 297 distinct
base commits, and fetching a tree for each would mean 297 multi-megabyte responses. A
repository's *file paths* barely move between commits, so one listing per repo covers
every instance in it. That approximation is not free, and `coverage()` measures what it
costs: the fraction of instances whose gold file is missing from the listing. Anything
missing is counted as an automatic retrieval failure rather than quietly dropped, so the
scores in Phase 2 are pessimistic by exactly that amount, never optimistic.

The fallback path exists because the network here kills large responses mid-transfer.
A recursive fetch of django/django is ~2 MB and dies; the same tree walked one
top-level subtree at a time arrives in pieces small enough to survive.
